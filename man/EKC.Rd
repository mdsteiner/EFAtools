\item{x}{data.frame or matrix. data.frame or matrix of raw data or matrix with
correlations.}

\item{N}{numeric. The number of observations. Only needed if x is a correlation
matrix.}

\item{use}{character. Passed to \code{\link[stats:cor]{stats::cor}} if raw
data is given as input. Default is  \code{"pairwise.complete.obs"}.}

Default is  \code{"pearson"}.}

\item{type}{character. The calculation of EKC. type \code{"BvA2017"} is the original implementation; type \code{"AM2019"} differs from the original implementation but was used in simulation studies (Auerswald & Moshagen, 2019; Caron, 2025). See details.
Use \code{type = c("BvA2017", "AM2019")} for both implementations. Make sure
to report which version you used.}

\description{
The empirical Kaiser criterion incorporates random sampling variations of the
eigenvalues from the Kaiser-Guttman criterion (\code{\link{KGC}}; see Auerswald & Moshagen
, 2019; Braeken & van Assen, 2017). The code is based on Braeken & van Assen, (2017) and on Auerswald and Moshagen
(2019).

\details{
The Kaiser-Guttman criterion was defined with the intend that a factor
 should only be extracted if it explains at least as much variance as a single
 factor (see \code{\link{KGC}}). However, this only applies to population-level
 correlation matrices. Due to sampling variation, the KGC strongly overestimates
 the number of factors to retrieve (e.g., Zwick & Velicer, 1986). To account
 for this and to introduce a factor retention method that performs well with
 small number of indicators and correlated factors (cases where the performance
 of parallel analysis, see \code{\link{PARALLEL}}, is known to deteriorate)
 Braeken and van Assen (2017) introduced the empirical Kaiser criterion in
 which a series of reference eigenvalues is created as a function of the
 variables-to-sample-size ratio and the observed eigenvalues.

 Braeken and van Assen (2017) showed that "(a) EKC performs about as well as
 parallel analysis for data arising from the null, 1-factor, or orthogonal
 factors model; and (b) clearly outperforms parallel analysis for the specific
 case of oblique factors, particularly whenever factor intercorrelation is
 moderate to high and the number of variables per factor is small, which is
 characteristic of many applications these days" (p.463-464).

 In EFAtools version <= 0.5.0 only the implementation of Auerswald and
 Moshagen (2019) was implemented (now available with
 \code{type = "AM2019"}). However, this implementation, that was probably also used in Caron (2025), differs from the
 original implementation by Braeken and van Assen (2017) in that it corrects by the reference values, i.e., without
 using the empirical eigenvalues used in the original implementation.
 Thanks to Luis Eduardo Garrido for pointing this out and to Johan Braeken for sharing
 sample code, based on which the original version is now implemented and used
 by default with \code{type = "BvA2017"}.

 While the adapted version performed relatively well
 in the simulation studies by Auerswald and Moshagen (2019) and Caron (2025),
 the theoretical derivations of the EKC as introduced by Braeken and van Assen (2017)
 may no longer hold. Currently we are unaware of studies comparing the two implementations,
 but based on our own brief comparisons across multiple datasets, the two implementations
 appear to often differ substantially regarding the number of factors suggested.

 As both implementations exist in different packages and studies, we provide both
 versions here. Be sure to state clearly which version you use when reporting your
 results to avoid confusion and ensure reproducibility.

 The \code{EKC} function can also be called together with other factor
  retention criteria in the \code{\link{N_FACTORS}} function.
