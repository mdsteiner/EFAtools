#' \describe{
#'   \item{final_communalities}{(vector) - The final communalities obtained with the FACTOR algorithm with PAF and no rotation. For details see Grieder and Grob (2019).}
#'   \item{final_eigenvalues}{(vector) - Final eigenvalues obtained with the FACTOR algorithm with PAF and no rotation.}
#'   \item{loadings_unrotated}{(matrix) - F1 to F5 = unrotated factor loadings obtained with the FACTOR algorithm with PAF. Rownames are the abbreviated subtest names. For details see Grieder and Grob (2019).}
#'   \item{paf_iter}{(numeric) - Number of iterations needed for the principal axis factoring to converge.}
#'   \item{loadings_varimax}{(matrix) - F1 to F5 = varimax rotated factor loadings obtained with the FACTOR algorithm with PAF. Rownames are the abbreviated subtest names. For details see Grieder and Grob (2019).}
#'   \item{loadings_promax}{(matrix) - F1 to F5 = promax rotated factor loadings obtained with the FACTOR algorithm with PAF. Rownames are the abbreviated subtest names. For details see Grieder and Grob (2019).}
#'   \item{structure_promax}{(matrix) - F1 to F5  = promax rotated factor loadings obtained with the FACTOR algorithm with PAF. Rownames are the abbreviated subtest names. For details see Grieder and Grob (2019).}
#'   \item{phi_promax}{(matrix) - F1 to F5  = intercorrelations of the promax rotated loadings.}
#'   \item{sl}{(matrix) - g = General / second order factor of the Schmid-Leiman solution. F1 to F5  = First order factors of the Schmid-Leiman solution. h2 = Communalities of the Schmid-Leiman solution. This Schmid-Leiman solution was found using the SPSS Syntax provided by Wolff and Preising (2005).}
#'   \item{L2}{(matrix) - Second order loadings used for the Schmid-Leiman transformation. This Schmid-Leiman solution was found using the SPSS Syntax provided by Wolff and Preising (2005).}
